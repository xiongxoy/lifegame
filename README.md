Life Game
---------------------
I wanted to write a life game when I was a freshman.
But I didn't succeed that time.
Now, I want to do it again.

I's very sad to see that a 3D Life Game is shown in a book about java game programing.
Is it really worthwhile to do that again?

I think I will try to run that game first and see if I can improve it.
